This is for a specific website called https://www.ourworldofpixels.com

I made this script so artists can make their art without having to worry about griefers
Theres several features including new tools, ability to change the right click color, and pasting.

This is mostly for my own enjoyment to see what I can make and to allow for artists to have an easier time making art.

Please create a new issue to leave suggestions on tools/features that I can add to make the script better.

# Requirements

* It requires Tamper Monkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/

# Optional

* It may be used alongside OPM 2 (https://opm.dimden.dev/) for extra quality of life features but is not required.

# How to use

Go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoNoka/Neko-OWOP-Scripts/main/index.js and copy everything into a new Tamper Monkey file.
