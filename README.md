This is for a specific website called https://www.ourworldofpixels.com

I made this script so artists can make their art without having to worry about griefers
Theres several features including new tools, ability to change the right click color, and pasting.

This is mostly for my own enjoyment to see what I can make and to allow for artists to have an easier time making art.

Please create a new issue to leave suggestions on tools/features that I can add to make the script better.

# Instructions

There is no inherent requirements to running the script but there is two ways to run it.

If you want to get automatic updates or you don't want to bother running the script when you join the website.
* You can install Tamper Monkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/
* Then go to https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445667-neko-s-scripts and click install.

If you do not want to install anything but still want to use the script.
* You can go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoNoka/Neko-OWOP-Scripts/main/index.js and paste the script directly into your browsers console.

# Optional

It may be used alongside OPM 2 (https://opm.dimden.dev/) for extra quality of life features but is not required.
