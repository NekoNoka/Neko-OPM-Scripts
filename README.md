This is for a specific website called https://www.ourworldofpixels.com

This is a project of mine mostly for my own enjoyment to see what I can make and to allow for artists to have an easier time making art.

Please leave suggestions on tools/features that I can add to make it better.

# Requirements

* It requires Tamper Monkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/

# Optional

* It may be used alongside OPM 2 (https://opm.dimden.dev/) for extra quality of life features but is not required.

# How to use

Go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoNoka/Neko-OPM-Scripts/main/index.js and copy everything into a new Tamper Monkey file.
