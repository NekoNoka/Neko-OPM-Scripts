This is a project of mine mostly for my own enjoyment to see what I can make and to allow for artists to have an easier time making art.

Please leave suggestions on what I can add to make it better.

# Requirements

## It requires OPM 2 https://opm.dimden.dev/
## It requires Tamper Monkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/

# How to use

## Go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoNoka/Neko-OPM-Scripts/main/tools.js and copy everything into a new Tamper Monkey file (If you just installed OPM 2 it's the exact same process as that).
